# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

###Course Project- Description:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###How to use this script:
. You should download and unzip the data source and put into a folder on your local drive.
. Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
. Run source run_analysis.R : you will have a new file tiny_data.txt in your working directory.
###Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
